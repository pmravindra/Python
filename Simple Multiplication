#This Program Calculates the Price of the Chocolates

#Declaration of Variables - Chocolate Prices
dChoc = 1.25
mChoc = 0.95
wChoc = 1.30

#Order quantity of each chocolate multipled by the cost of the corresponding chocolate
order = 3*dChoc + 2*mChoc + 1*wChoc
tax = 0.0795

#The cost of the customer order with tax
cost = order + order*tax

#Return the cost of the customer order with tax
print (cost)


#Further improvements - set aside sales tax as another variable (sTax = order*tax), set aside variables to store quantity of each chocolate ordered (qdChoc, qmChoc, qwChoc), add user input
